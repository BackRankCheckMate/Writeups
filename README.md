# Writeups
These writeups are how I attempted to solve different challenges in TryHackMe and HackTheBox platforms.
Some were solved all by self, Most required external hints and help.

These are simple writeups that are enough to refresh my mind on how I did what I did.
Feel free to help yourself, if you can understand my writing hehe.
